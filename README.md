# Getting Started with Puzzle game
To start playing the puzzle game, click and hold on an image tile from the left board with your mouse or touchpad.

Drag the image tile to the right board where you think it fits into the puzzle.

Release the mouse button or lift your finger to drop the image tile into place.

Repeat this process for each image tile until the puzzle is complete.

If you need to move an image tile that you've already placed, click and hold on the tile again to pick it up, then drag it to a new location on the right board.

Keep in mind that some image tiles may look like they fit in multiple places, but only one location will be correct. Use the shapes and colors of the puzzle pieces to guide you.

If you're having trouble finding the right spot for a particular image tile, try swapping it with another tile to see if it fits better elsewhere in the puzzle.
